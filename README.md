# BT2201 Task HTML Module Page

## Introduction

### Overview

Just like in last week's workshop you will add some content to a very basic html document. This time the html document is called 'modules.html'. It can be found in this repository. 

### Editing

#### The quick way...

If you like you can edit the document directly in GitHub's web interface. This is a very convenient way of editing the file. 

If you want to test your files (especially in the future when we've started using PHP) you should upload them to your web space on bimserver2.com. 

If you want to have a quick look whether your html files are working you can check by using the HTML preview site http://htmlpreview.github.io/? - simply add http://htmlpreview.github.io/? before the URL of your HTML file.   

#### The preferred way...

The preferred way of working is to edit the files on your own machine. 

To get the repository to your own machine you can use GitHub Desktop or link your GitHub account to PHPStorm (there are many more ways but these two are very convenient).


* You then upload these files to bimserver2 for testing.
* You commit changes and push the commits to create a history of the changes over time.
* You can work on several machines and use commits as a way of keeping the files on different machines up to date. 

## Task

Below is today's task. You have to do this work in the 'modules.html' file. It can be found in the same repository as the text you are currently reading. 

* Add information about all the modules you study this year to the html document. 
* Module codes and titles should be headings.
* Add very short module descriptions for each module. These should be paragraphs.
* Give the page a meaningful title
* Upload this file to your area on bimserver2.com

Commit early, commit often - that way you can go back if you have made a mistake and I can see all the work you have done. There's no problem if you commit and there's a mistake in your file.  

Once you are done be sure to commit your changes (that will save them to the repository) and to push them to GitHub (so that I can see the work you have done).

This task is part of your first assignment. 

As this task is part of the first assignment you should not work together and not show the final version of your files on the module discussion board.
